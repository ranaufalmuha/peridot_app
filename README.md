# Peridot Project

Welcome to the Peridot Project repository!

## Overview

The Peridot Project is designed to implement the PER token, leveraging the ICP crypto platform. This repository contains all the necessary components and documentation to understand and contribute to the project.

## Token.mo

The design of the PER token is based on a minting mechanism using ICP crypto, with cyclical divisions intended to maintain the token's value stability.

- **Initial Launch**: The exchange rate is set at 5,000,000 PER for 1 ICP Crypto.
- **First Cycle**: When the number of tokens reaches 5,000,000,000 PER, equivalent to 1000 ICP, the minting process is halved.
  - New Exchange Rate: 2,500,000 PER for 1 ICP Crypto.

This cyclical halving continues to ensure the stability of the token's value over time.
